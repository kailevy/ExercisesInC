### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of 
the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that
is not literally true about the implementation?

Buying an item off of an online retailer is a real-world form of virtualization. The retailer doesn't make all the items themselves, but rather collects them to be shipped off to you, and they create the illusion that they have almost anything in stock.

2. What is the difference between a program and a process?

A program is a set of executable instructions, while a process is a software instance currently executing some program instructions. 

3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction? 

Abstraction is used so that a programmer does not need to learn the minute details of everything that their program will interact with. It allows us to build more complex systems.

4. What illusion does the process abstraction create?

Process abstraction creates illusions about machine hardware and allows processes to share resources.

5. What is the kernel?

The kernel is the part of an OS that is responsible for resource allocation.

6. What is a daemon?

A daemon is an OS process that runs in the background and handles OS services.
