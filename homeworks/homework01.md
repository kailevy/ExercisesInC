a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1) Give an example of a feature common in interpreted languages that is rare in compiled languages.

Dynamic typing is common in interpretted languages.

2) Name two advantages of static typing over dynamic typing.

Static typing is harder to use wrong and get unexplainable errors. It also saves memory.

3) Give an example of a static semantic error.

Calling a function with too few arguments.

4) What are two reasons you might want to turn off code optimization?

For debugging, or if the optimization somehow changes the execution (unlikely).

5) When you run `gcc` with `-S`, why might the results look different on different computers?

6) If you spell a variable name wrong, or if you spell a function name wrong, the error messages you get might look very different.  Why?

The error may come may come from a different step in compilation e.g. parsing vs linking.

7) What is a segmentation fault?
